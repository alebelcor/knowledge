# [BEM](http://getbem.com/)

BEM stands for **B**lock **E**lement **M**odifier, a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development.

It's based on a simple naming convention–using HTML classes–and three key concepts:

1. **Block**: a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own (e.g. `nav`)
1. **Element**: a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block (e.g. `nav__item`)
1. **Modifier**: a flag on a block or element used to change appearance or behavior (e.g. `nav__item--active`)
