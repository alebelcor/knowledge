# Web Accessibility

[Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#what) is the practice that ensures websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.

It's important for [a number of reasons](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility#case) like, the need for equal access to the web for everyone, and [many more](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#important).

Web accessibility relies on several components that work together:

* Web content: any part of a website
* User agents: software used to access web content
* Authoring tools: software or services used to produce web content

The [W3C](https://www.w3.org) Web Accessibility Initiative ([WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)) develops Web accessibility standards for these different components:

* Web content: [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
* User agents: [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)
* Authoring tools: [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)

At the top are [four principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/) that provide the foundation for Web accessibility:

1. [Perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#perceivable)
1. [Operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#operable)
1. [Understandable](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#understandable)
1. [Robust](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#robust)

Under the principles are _guidelines_ that provide the basic goals that authors should work toward:

1. Perceivable
    * [Provide text alternatives for non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#text-alternatives)
    * [Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#time-based-media)
    * [Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing meaning](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#adaptable)
    * [Make it easier for users to see and hear content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#distinguishable)
1. Operable
    * [Make all functionality available from a keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#keyboard-accessible)
    * [Provide users enough time to read and use content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#enough-time)
    * [Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#seizures-and-physical-reactions)
    * [Help users navigate and find content](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#navigable)
    * [Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#input-modalities)
1. Understandable
    * [Make text readable and understandable](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#readable)
    * [Make content appear and operate in predictable ways](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#predictable)
    * [Help users avoid and correct mistakes](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#input-assistance)
1. Robust
    * [Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/#compatible)

For each guideline, there are testable _success criteria_, which are at three levels of conformance: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). For more on guidelines and success criterion see [Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/).

For each guideline and success criteria there are documented _techniques_ which fall into two categories: those that are _sufficient_ for meeting the success criteria and those that are _advisory_ which go beyond what is required and allow for better addressing of the guidelines. For more on techniques see [Techniques for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/).
